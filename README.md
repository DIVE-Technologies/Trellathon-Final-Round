# Trellathon 

## Feature 1: On the Go Map

We propose an On The Go Map feature in the existing Trell app, to enhance content exploration and personalization. 

We would introduce a Map, which is user interactive and will have a _colour based density depiction (Heat Map)_ of Trails present in that particular region. 

The Map also will feature trending places to explore, buzzing cuisines (food), entertainment content and travel vlogs, which will be easily accessible with a click.

As per our evaluation, this will help Trell to increase its user base by over 30%, as it is a feature still missing in the competitors and would give Trell a USP.


## Feature 2: Catalogues in profile

The content creators on the Trell regularly upload trails for users to watch. But at the same time, there is no such option to arrange them and show users a group of related trails.

So, we propose a Catalogue Guide, in which the content creator can arrange the trails in the order they want users to watch along with some relevant text. 

This will be like an interactive magazine but with trails embedded in it.
